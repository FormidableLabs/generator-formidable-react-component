# generator-formidable-react-component [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/FormidableLabs/generator-formidable-react-component.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FormidableLabs/generator-formidable-react-component)

This generator creates a react component scaffold with webpack.  Linting, testing with Karma, and a minimal demo runner are included.  This scaffold is heavily influenced by [react-shuffle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-shuffle)

To install generator-formidable-react-component from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-formidable-react-component
```

Finally, initiate the generator from a fresh directory:

```bash
yo formidable-react-component
```
